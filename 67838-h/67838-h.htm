<h1>INSTRUCTIONS<br />
<span class="smaller">FOR THE</span><br />
MANAGEMENT OF HARVEY’S SEA TORPEDO.</h1>

<p>To impart a thorough knowledge of the management of
such an arm as the sea torpedo is a matter of easy accomplishment
by personal explanation; especially so, when the
arm is in the water, and practised with under conditions
that would obtain in its application to the disabling of, or
to the destruction of vessels against which it may be employed.</p>

<p>But in the absence of such mode of instruction, the following
directions are offered, with a hope that they will
prove sufficiently explanatory of an arm, which, like other
arms, requires skill and aptitude in using it effectively.</p>

<p>By the instructions here given, it must be understood,
there are two torpedoes; though both are of the same kind,
they differ in construction, by reason of the difference in
the position of their respective planes, so that one may
diverge to port, and the other to starboard; the direction
of the divergence is known by the position of the slings
and rudder. There is a like difference in the exploding
bolts; the bolts which respectively belong to the port and
starboard torpedoes are known by the direction of their
safety keys.</p>

</div>

<p>The sea torpedo has the advantage of exploding only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
when in hugging contact with the vessel attacked; the
levers by which it is exploded are so placed in relation to
the tow-rope, that either the side or top lever is found
invariably to act effectively in forcing down the exploding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
bolt at the instant of contact; this has been ascertained by
the result of many experimental trials.</p>

<p>The shape is an irregular figure, which can be best understood
by reference to the drawings (<a href="#Page_4">p. 4</a>). The dimensions
of exterior case are as follows:—</p>

<p>The exterior case is made of well-seasoned elm 1½ in.
thick, iron bound, and screwed together with water-tight
packing between the joints, also cemented with pitch.
The interior case is made of stout sheet copper; the case
has two loading holes corresponding in size to two holes in
the deck, or top of the exterior case. These holes are made
sufficiently large to load with gun-cotton discs, if preferred.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
The loading holes are fitted with corks, which are inserted
before screwing on the brass cap, to prevent any chance of
accident through friction in screwing on the cap; the bushing
has the thread of the screw on the outside for the same
reason. If thought necessary, the cork can be cemented
over before screwing on the cap, which will render the
joint doubly secure from leakage. The centre of the copper
case has a stout copper tube, which is soldered to the top
and bottom surfaces of the copper case, the charge being
all round it; into this centre tube is screwed the priming
case. It should be understood that both the exterior and
inner cases are thoroughly water-tight, so that in the event
of the outer case being damaged, still the charge in the
interior case is preserved perfectly dry, the cases being
altogether independent of each other.</p>

<p>The capacity of the copper case of the large torpedo is
such that it will contain 77 lbs. of water; the capacity of
the small one, 28 lbs.; from these can be determined the
quantity of any explosive agent with which it may be
desired to charge either torpedo.</p>

<p>The charges of various powders the torpedoes will contain
are as follows:—</p>

<p>The above must be considered an approximation, since
much will depend upon the labour expended in packing the
torpedo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>Some of the powders named have not yet been manufactured
on a large scale.</p>

<p>The priming case is made of stout sheet copper, and
contains a large bursting charge, which may be either
rifle grained powder or a stronger explosive,
which is recommended.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 200px;">

</div>

</div>

<p>In the centre of the priming case is a
brass tube in which the exploding bolt
works, and at the bottom of this tube
is a steel-pointed pin, which pierces the
capsule on the muzzle of the exploding
bolt, when the bolt is forced down. At
the side of the brass tube, and near the
base of the pin, is a small hole, covered
with thin brass foil, which will allow of
an escape of water into the priming
case, should any have collected at the
bottom of the tube. The loading hole of the priming case
is at the bottom of the case, and arranged with cork and
cap upon the same principle as the loading holes for main
charge. A powerful spanner is provided
for screwing in the priming case
and caps of main loading holes, which
are fitted with leather washers to form
a water-tight joint. The priming case
can be stored separate from the torpedo
if preferred, but there is no
necessity for so doing unless it is
charged with a dangerous compound.
When the torpedoes are being stored, a wooden plug is
inserted into the brass tube of the priming case; there is a
cavity in the plug at the lower end; the cavity is filled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
a greasy composition, into which runs the pin of the
priming case when the ping is in its place; the pin is
thus protected from corrosion, and the tube of the case
secured from any foreign matter getting accidentally
into it.</p>

<p>The exploding bolt is fitted to work with a pressure of
about 50 lbs. on the head of the bolt for the large torpedo,
and 20 lbs. for the small.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<p class="caption">(F)</p>
<img src="images/figure-f.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On account of the great proportional
length of the stuffing box, it is quite
impossible for water to enter into the
tube, and the pressure can be regulated
to the greatest nicety by the quantity
of thread wound on. The bolts are
easily kept in order by turning them
round occasionally in their tubes, stored
as they would be in the bolt magazine
(see <a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>, Fig. Y). The best lubrication
for them is hog’s lard free from salt, beeswax,
neat’s-foot oil, in proportion 3, 1, 1.
The bolt has several grooves for the thread stuffing to be
wound on, and in the event of its working too easy, a few
turns of whity-brown thread on the two lower stuffings
will suffice; should it work too stiff, revolve it in the
magazine tube until it works with the desired amount of
pressure, which, after a little practice, is well known by
the hand. In the event of a few drops of water entering
the tube, which has never occurred, a provision is made
for its escape (see priming case), that it may not impede
the descent of the bolt. The cavity in the bolt for containing
the exploding composition is, in length and diameter,
sufficient to contain a charge that will of itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
explode the torpedo (see Fig G), without depending upon
the priming case. The bolts are all the same size, and
differ only in the direction of the slot for safety key, being
port or starboard bolts accordingly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="caption">(H)</p>
<img src="images/figure-h.jpg" width="200" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

</div>

<p>The muzzle of the exploding bolt stands one inch off the
pin when in safety position, that is, when the safety key
rests on the brasswork of the priming case. This can
always be ascertained before entering the bolt (if thought
necessary) by a wooden gauge forced down until it touches
the point of the pin, which measurement transferred to the
bolt will show the distance of the muzzle when forced
down to the safety position.</p>

<p>The safety key is secured in the slot of the exploding
bolt by eight or nine parts of strong whity-brown thread
secured to the key, as shown in Fig. J (<a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>), passed round
the bolt, and securely knotted in this manner; the parts of
the thread come away with the key when drawn, in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
that none of the parts may be worked down the tube
by the exploding bolt.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">(I)</p>

<div class="figmulti" style="width: 200px;">
<p class="caption">(J)</p>
<img src="images/figure-j.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

</div>

<p>In the event of the large torpedo being cut away in
deep water after withdrawal of the safety key, it will
explode by pressure on the head of the bolt at about
sixty fathoms depth. The small one at about thirty.</p>

<p>The brass guard for the exploding bolt is an extra
precaution (suggested by Capt. A. Hood, R.N., Director-General
of Naval Ordnance) should
any person by mistake attempt to place
the bolt into the torpedo without the
safety key in its place. It is placed
over the head of the bolt and pushed
down until the thumb-screw on the
side works into a small hole in the
shoulder of the bolt.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The manner in
which this guard is fitted ensures its removal before launching,
since the after lever cannot be placed until it is. It
also makes a convenient handle for turning the bolt in the
magazine.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> As the certainty of explosion depends mainly upon the exploding bolt
being properly charged, the inventor takes entire charge of this important detail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<p class="caption">(K)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>The explosive composition in the bolts is powerful and
safe; so packed that no amount of concussion can explode
it; the bolt must be pierced through the capsule at the
muzzle for that purpose. The bolts are hermetically sealed
at the muzzle by a metallic capsule, and can be stored for
an indefinite length of time without chance of deterioration.
The exploding point of the composition in the bolt is 420°
Fahrenheit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<p class="caption">(L)</p>
<img src="images/figure-l.jpg" width="500" height="275" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The side and top levers are so arranged, that when
driven close into the torpedo, the bolt is down to the
shoulder; and, since there are three explosions to take
place, it is calculated the torpedo will be in hugging contact
when the main charge explodes, and exploded by a
powerful discharge in the centre, thereby disposing of the
explosive force to the greatest advantage.</p>

<p>The torpedo must be closing to the ship when the levers
are acting and the bolt descending; no experiment for the
force of explosive agents, with a cushion of water intervening,
is required. The amount of explosive agent, when
in contact, is all that is required, and the torpedo can be
manufactured to contain a larger charge, if thought necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
with a very small increase of dimensions; but the
present size is convenient for handling and launching; and
if loaded with any of the powerful blasting powders, would,
in all probability, prove sufficient to bilge or destroy the
largest iron-clad.</p>

<p>The lanyard or side-lever is permanently secured to the
short arm of the lever; the end is rove under the fair lead
on the deck of the torpedo
up through the
brass oval hole in the
after top lever, then
down under the fair lead
(abaft the first turn),
and across the deck
of the torpedo to the
handle, and secured with a round turn and two half-hitches.
Care should be taken that the short arm of the lever is
brought close into the fair lead, and the lanyard should be
set up sufficiently taut to give a slight spring in the after
top lever by the strain brought on it. This lever has a
steel fish on the top, in order to prevent it taking a permanent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
bend. If the side-lever lanyard is properly set up,
the bolt will spring down about one-eighth of an inch when
the safety key is withdrawn, owing to the spring in the
lever and shrinking of the lanyard; this brings the muzzle
one-eighth of an inch nearer the pin without disturbing
the side lever. The lanyard should be made up like a
reef-point; it should be well-greased immediately before
launching.</p>

<p>To secure the fore top lever to the after, in order that a
back hit may not separate them, the small lanyards, with
an eye in one end, and whipped at the other, are first
placed over the eyes in the fore top lever, then rove
through the brass hole in the after top lever, in opposite
directions, passed up through the eyes in the fore top lever,
and knotted over it. The distance from the eyes in the
fore top lever to the hole in the after top lever is so arranged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
that it will not interfere with the descent of them. The
fore-locks for the various bolts which fix the levers are
made of fishing-line. After knotting them, the ends should

<p>The handles, formed of iron straps passing under the
torpedo, and terminating in four eyes above the deck,
are principally for handling
it; one of the foremost
eyes is made use of as a
fair lead for the safety-key
lanyard, and to stop it to;
the other foremost is made
use of to secure the side
lanyard to Fig. N (<a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>).</p>

<p>The ballast is composed
of iron and sheet lead; the
former, a fixture to the wooden bottom of the torpedo;
the latter, screwed on with long screws into the iron. A
thin sheet of lead is always kept on the bottom, affording
a soft material for moving them about on, removing the
objection that may be made to the friction caused by an
iron bottom in the moving of them in the torpedo-room.
By taking out these screws, several more thicknesses of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
sheet-lead can be screwed on, the same screws binding all
together. On leaving the manufacturers, there is sufficient
lead placed on the bottom for a speed between three and
ten knots. A very large increase of ballast would require
another buoy to be strung on over and above the usual
complement.</p>

<p>The proper adjustment of the slings is most important,
as the divergence depends upon it. The after legs of the
slings, when stretched out alongside the torpedo, should
extend one foot beyond the stem iron of the torpedo for
the large torpedo, and eight inches for the small one; the
distance on the slings being reckoned from the seizing
round the thimble. This first adjustment is near enough
if within two inches of the regulation.</p>

<p>The thimble of the slings is made suitable for wire or
hemp rope, the fore surface of it being bell-mouthed, to
prevent chafe of the tow-rope; the thimble is so constructed
that the parts of the slings cannot escape from
the groove should the seizing become slack; it will be
observed that by this arrangement the edge of the thimble
is not brought in contact when rounding the stem or stern
of a vessel, the nip after leaving the tow-rope coming
direct on to the fore span, and thence to the projecting
curve of the side lever.</p>

<p>When all four legs are pulled out, in direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
tow-rope, they bear an equal strain; the junction of
the four legs should be on a level with the upper towing-irons,
at the same time the upper fore span should make
an angle between 80° and 85° with the near side of the
torpedo. This arrangement gives the best divergence with
the least strain on the tow-rope, and is suitable when the
torpedo is kept at short scope, as well as when a long
length of tow-line is out. The slings are made of the best
Italian hemp (not laid up too hard), the rope being of the
same strength as the tow-rope; for although in towing
four legs divide the strain, yet during collision the strain
might be brought on one or two.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> It may be here remarked, the small rudder on the stern of the torpedo is not
for the purpose of increasing the divergence, but to control the direction of the
torpedo when the tow-rope is suddenly slacked.</p>

<p>The tow-rope for large torpedo can be of 2½ in. or 3 in.
hemp, or 1½ in. flexible galvanized iron wire. For small
torpedo, 1½ in. to 2 in. hemp, or ⅞ in. wire.</p>

<p>The buoys are made of solid cork (such cork only being
used as will ensure great floating power after being immersed
for a time), it is built up on a galvanized iron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
tube, running longitudinally through; on the ends of the
tube are screwed wooden cones, which bind all together
and render the buoy indestructible. The iron tube gives
great facility for stringing on the number of buoys required.</p>

<p>Two buoys are generally used for the large torpedo, and
one for the small. The buoy-rope is of hemp, about five
or six fathoms in length and two inches circumference, an
eye being spliced in the end nearest the torpedo; to this
eye is bent the tow-rope with a single or double sheet
bend, forming the knot by which the torpedo is towed;
the other end of the buoy-rope is passed through the large
or small ring in the stern (according to whether working
in deep or shallow water), then through the tube of the first
buoy, an overhand knot made in the rear; then through
the next buoy, and a knot in the rear of that.</p>

<p>The brakes are used for the purpose of controlling the
tow-ropes; they can be fixed by screws into the deck at
the most convenient place for command, and, in a properly-constructed
vessel, would be worked below the water-line to
prevent exposure of the men. They are so arranged as
to admit of the tow-rope being quickly veered, and at the
same time powerful in bringing the torpedo to the surface
when required. Success greatly depends on the skilful
handling of these brakes, for in conjunction with the cork
buoys they give the operator command of the depth at
which the enemy is to be struck. The handles on the
leather straps are for the purpose of lifting the strap off
the drum when veering suddenly, that there may be no
friction to interfere. The handles for winding up would
rarely be used in real action, and never should be on when
veering. Unless a very high rate of speed is required, one
handspike will control the tow-rope; the other strap can be
thrown off the drum, and the handspike allowed to lie on
the deck ready to be thrown into gear, if necessary. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
surface of the drum in contact with the strap should be
powdered with rosin to increase the friction. The tow-rope
should be so reeled up, that in veering the reel may revolve
towards the men at the handspike (see <a href="#plate2">Plate 2</a>). The spindle
will contain several tow-ropes, that, in the event of one
torpedo being cut away, another can be immediately bent.</p>

<p>The brake for small torpedo requires only one drum and
handspike. It can be fitted to a steam-launch by placing
an extra thwart across near one of the others.</p>

<p>The drawing shows a small brake fitted for the electric
torpedo, having a hollow central spindle, through which the
end of the tow-rope carrying the insulated wire is rove,
after passing out at the axle; a swivel connection is made
with the battery. The brakes, both large and small, are so
made as to ensure durability, they being considered a part
of the ship’s furniture.</p>

<p>Brake for safety-key line is a small reel on the same
principle. When going a slow speed, it may not be necessary,
as the safety-key line can be attended by hand; but
when going ten or eleven knots, it will be found of considerable
advantage, both in keeping the light of the safety-key
line from dragging astern, thereby lessening the divergence
of the torpedo, and also in drawing the safety key<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
when a strong stop is used. The ordinary deep-sea lead
line can be used for a safety-key line, or any hemp-rope
from three-quarters to an inch circumference. It should
be new and of good quality; for in the event of its carrying
away before the stop, it would necessitate the recovery of
the torpedo.</p>

<p>The magazine for exploding bolts is fitted with exactly
the same size brass tubing as in the priming case; therefore,
if the bolts are kept to work with the proper pressure
when in the magazine, they will do so in the torpedo.
This magazine should be kept apart from the torpedo-room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and care should be taken that the tube is clear before
forcing the loaded bolt into it. The torpedoes are then no
more dangerous than any other powder case, and, being
very strongly made and sealed, are probably less so.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Arrangements required for Launching and Towing.</span></h2>

<p>A yard across either the main or mizen mast of a torpedo
vessel, from ten to fifteen feet above the water-line, is a
very convenient method for launching and towing. The
leading block on the yard, through which the tow-rope is
rove, may be fitted to a traveller on the yard with an
inhaul and outhaul, that the distance out from the ship’s
side may be regulated as convenient.</p>

<p>In a large vessel, the leading block for tow-rope can be
fixed to the end of the quarter-boat’s davits. The brakes
for commanding the tow-rope should be screwed firmly to
the deck. In a vessel properly constructed for the service,
they would be on the lower deck, the tow-rope having
been led along the yard, and down each side of the mast.</p>

<p>A leading block for the tow-rope is placed on the deck
by span or bolt a few feet in front of the brake. The safety-key
reel, if used, must be fixed in a convenient position on
deck, that the man attending it can see how to control it;
in a properly-constructed vessel he would be in the pilot-house.
The safety-key line leads through a small leading
block on the ensign-staff or some convenient point abaft the
lead of the tow-rope, that it may be kept well clear of it.
The leading block on the yard may be fitted with a lizard,
if thought necessary. A sharp instrument should be kept
by the brakes ready to sever the tow-rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Preparations for Launching and Towing.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The torpedoes, port and starboard, loaded and ballasted,
having been hoisted out of the torpedo-room, are placed on
the deck on their own sides, with their heads forward under
the leading block, and the number of buoys required for
each, placed abaft them, strung together as directed (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>);
the necessary number of exploding bolts having also been
taken from the bolt magazine, are now entered into the
torpedoes, and forced down until their safety keys rest on
the brasswork, taking care that each safety key points in
the direction of the eye through which its lanyard has to
pass; the brass guard is now taken off, and after top lever
placed in the crutch of the exploding bolt; the fore top
lever is now placed on the shoulder of the after one, and
the two levers secured by their lanyards, as directed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
pages <a href="#Page_12">12</a> and <a href="#Page_13">13</a>. The eye at the end of the buoy-rope is
now rove through the large or small ring in the stern end
of the torpedo (see <a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>). The tow-rope having been previously
rove through the leading block on the deck and on
the yard, is rove through the thimble of the slings from
forward aft, and bent, with a single or double sheet bend,
to the eye of the buoy-rope. The safety-key line having
been previously rove through the leading block on the
ensign-staff, and the lanyard on the safety key having been
led through the eye of the handle, making a fair lead with
the slit in the bolt, are bent together with a double-sheet
bend, and stopped to the eye by a split yarn of suitable
strength, the yarn having been secured outside the bend.
It can also be stopped with another split yarn to the slings
near the thimble of the slings. The torpedo is now ready
for launching.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Launching the Torpedo.</span></h2>

<p>The crew having been stationed at their respective posts,
the handles having been shipped on the tow-reel, the tow-line
is then reeled up until the torpedo will launch clear,
and swing out under the leading block on the yard. Hold
the torpedo by the handspikes, and take off the handles of
the brake. In swinging out, care should be taken that in
starting from the deck the fore slings do not foul the fore
top lever. The stern of the torpedo can be steadied by
keeping a slight strain on the buoy-rope. The safety-key
line must be kept clear, and not checked, or it might break
the stop and draw the safety key before intended.</p>

<p>The buoys must be placed in a proper position, and
hands stationed by them to launch them overboard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
instant the torpedo takes the water. It would be better
to stop the screw, if circumstances would allow of it, when
lowering the torpedo and buoys into the water, to prevent
the chance of the buoys fouling the screw. The torpedo,
on reaching the water, will <i>immediately</i> diverge clear of the
ship; the buoys being launched, as the strain comes on
the buoy-rope, they will be towed clear away from the
screw, and full speed may be put on at once. The men at
the handspikes must veer steadily, occasionally checking
the torpedo, that it may be kept near the surface, and not
allowed to dive, which it will do if the tow-rope is slacked
up altogether, and then a sudden strain brought on it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Drawing 4.</span></p>
<img src="images/drawing-4.jpg" width="500" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Eventually it will come to the surface, when the bow is
pointed up by the strain on the tow-rope; greater the speed
the more quickly will it be brought to the surface. In
shallow water this should be particularly attended to, as in
diving it might strike the bottom and injure the levers;
and if the safety key has been withdrawn, explode; moreover
it brings an undue strain on the tow-rope. The
torpedo can now be gradually veered out to the distance
required, the safety-key line so attended, that a sufficient
strain is kept on it as not to allow of a long bight of line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
dragging astern of the torpedo; at the same time having
due regard to the strength of the yarn by which the line is
stopped to the handle of the torpedo. The distance veered
must depend upon the nature of attack. The tow-line
should be marked with knots every ten fathoms; under
some circumstances the torpedo would be close to the ship
until passing the enemy (<i>see</i> <a href="#TACTICS">Tactics</a>); at other times
veered to 40 fathoms it will be found most suitable. The
full divergence of 45° is obtained up to 50 fathoms, beyond
that the bight of the tow-rope in the water drags the
torpedo astern unless the tow-rope is triced much higher
up, which has its disadvantage; 40 to 50 fathoms of tow-rope
gives the best command of the torpedo, veering 2 or 3
fathoms of tow-line suddenly will always sink the torpedo
some feet below the surface. Should it become necessary
to use the torpedoes with a stern-board they can be so used,
but in this case the port torpedo is used on the starboard
bow and starboard on the port; all other arrangements
being exactly the same. In rough weather, advantage
should be taken of the roll, and the torpedo allowed to
swing out from the yard, and be let go by the run, checking
the tow-rope immediately the torpedo is in the water. It
is not absolutely necessary to ease the vessel when launching,
the torpedo can be launched at full speed. In the
event of its being found necessary to cut adrift the torpedo,
in consequence of coming suddenly across a friendly vessel,
the tow-rope should be cut near the brake, and if the buoy-rope
has been rove through the large stern-ring, the torpedo
will sink and be lost, the buoy only remaining. If the buoy-rope
has been rove through the small stern-ring, the torpedo
will be suspended by the buoy-rope; and should the safety
key not have been withdrawn, can be recovered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
safety. In the event of wishing to recover it when the
buoy-rope has been rove through the large ring, a toggle
must be lashed on the tow-rope abaft the leading block on
the yard, when it can be recovered by the buoy-rope; as a
general rule, it will however be found best to expend the
torpedo, and not attempt its recovery. By slacking the
tow-rope roundly and stopping the vessel, a friendly ship
can pass over the bight of the tow-rope without striking
the torpedo; but this is rather a delicate operation, particularly
if the safety key has been withdrawn.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Recovering the Torpedo.</span></h2>

<p>Should the safety key have been withdrawn, great caution
must be used.</p>

</div>

<p>Tongs, for going round the upper part of the bolt, to take
the place of the safety key, when once clasped and secured
round the bolt, render the torpedo safe to handle; this
could only be done from a boat. With the safety key in,
there is no danger in hooking it inboard again by its own
tow-rope, and hoisting up the buoys at the same time with
a grapnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Torpedo arranged to Explode by Electricity.</span></h2>

<p>To substitute the electrical method of firing the torpedo
for the mechanical one, all that will be necessary is to
unscrew the priming case from the centre hole of the
mechanical torpedo, and screw in the electrical arrangement
which contains McEvoy’s patent circuit-closer, especially
adapted by him to suit this particular torpedo.</p>

<p>The electrical arrangement has its own exploding bolt,
which differs from the other only below the safety key,
which key is fitted and worked in the same manner as the
mechanical one, in order that the electrical arrangement
might not be disturbed by an accidental blow when launching.
The insulated conducting wire is carried along the
whole length of the tow-rope in the centre, forming a core.
The tow-rope, as in the mechanical one, is bent on to the
hemp buoy-rope by a sheet bend, the strands at the end
are then unlaid, sufficiently so to form a connection between
the insulated wire in the tow-rope and that projecting from
the centre hole of the torpedo; this connection can be best
made with McEvoy’s patent jointer. The other end of the
tow-rope on the barrel of the brake passes through the hollow
spindle of the brake at one extremity and is connected with
the constant battery, which must be suitable for heating
platinum at the distance of 100 fathoms, the return circuit
being by the water. The levers act in the same manner
as in the mechanical one, forcing down the bolt and
thereby closing the circuit through the fuze and exploding
the torpedo.</p>

<p>This system of exploding the torpedo may be preferred
in rivers or shallow water, where it would be considered
dangerous to leave a mechanical torpedo at the bottom;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
but it cannot be reckoned upon with the same certainty
as the mechanical one. It is necessarily more costly, complicated,
and delicate; the two latter conditions rendering
it unsuited for the rough work it will have to encounter.</p>

<p>The torpedo being provided with this centre tube in
addition to the usual priming case, admits of its being used
upon an emergency, special ones not being at hand, for
various other purposes, <i>viz.</i> clearing away obstructions;
as land torpedoes; as stationary torpedoes, provided they
are not to remain a very long time in the water. In these
cases the ordinary insulated wire and jointers are all that
is required. If required to be fired at will, it will be only
necessary to force down the bolt sufficiently to close the
circuit through the fuze and then secure it. If to be self-acting,
leave the bolt up in its position, as when working
at sea, to be acted upon by pressure.</p>

contact is broken when the metal bridge moves downward

When the insulated bridge <i>p</i> is in contact with the metal
bridge <i>u</i>, the electric fuze is out of circuit; and a current
sent through the torpedo will return by way of the earth
without firing the torpedo; but when contact with the
metal bridge <i>u</i> is broken, and contact with the insulated

<h2 id="TACTICS">TACTICS.</h2>

<p>Torpedo vessels should, as a rule, attack under the cover of
darkness. By the experience gained in blockade running
in the late American conflict, we are assured that a vessel
in rapid motion can, when it is dark, pass with impunity
close under the fire of hostile vessels, armed with cannon.</p>

<p>In the more early stage of the torpedo, the tactics of
vessels armed with torpedoes embraced modes of attack
that are not now entertained. So general is becoming the
use of torpedoes as a means both of defence and offence,
that vessels, which may be at anchor or moored in a
harbour or roadstead, would be protected by stationary
torpedoes; the use of which admits also of vessels, when
at anchor or moored, protecting themselves by placing a
web of torpedoes in such manner as to render the attack of
a hostile vessel or boats extremely hazardous, and therefore
not likely to be attempted. But in the event of a
vessel being at anchor in a harbour or roadstead unprotected,
she could be attacked, as shown in the illustration
of Tactics, under such conditions. As, however, vessels
armed with torpedoes are intended to work the arm
against vessels at sea or in motion, the management of
the torpedo in so attacking vessels is the more important
part of the code of Tactics.</p>

<p>It should be here remarked, that with a view to simplicity,
the explanations will be confined to a single
steamer, the attacking vessel adapted to the service of
the arm in question, and confined also to a single vessel,
the object of attack.</p>

<h3>CASE 1.<br />
<span class="smaller">ATTACKING A VESSEL MOORED HEAD AND STERN.</span></h3>

<p>In this case the torpedo vessel steers in for the bow or
quarter of the vessel attacked, according to the direction of
the current, and on the side approached launches the torpedo
between the moorings as at A; leaving the tow-rope
slack, the torpedo vessel proceeds ahead or astern against
the current, and when at a sufficient distance off, the tow-rope
is held fast, which will cause the torpedo to diverge
into contact with the vessel attacked, as shown by the
drawing.</p>

<h3>CASE 2.<br />
<span class="smaller">ATTACKING A VESSEL AT ANCHOR BY CROSSING THE BOW.</span></h3>

<p>In this case, the torpedo is sufficiently diverged when
near to the vessel with a good scope of tow-rope out.
After having crossed her bow, proceeding onwards, the
tow-rope will be brought obliquely across her cable, and
the torpedo will swing into her, as shown in the drawing.
It may be here remarked that, in all cases, the depth of
explosion can be obtained by the sudden slacking of the
tow-rope; and the tow-rope, once under the keel, causes
the torpedo to be hauled down near to it before exploding.</p>

<h3>CASE 3.<br />
<span class="smaller">ATTACKING A VESSEL AT ANCHOR BY PASSING ON EITHER SIDE
DETERMINED UPON, COMING UP FROM THE STERN.</span></h3>

<p>In this case, the torpedo is launched when on the quarter
of the vessel attacked, as at A, the tow-rope left slack.
After steaming ahead some distance, hold fast the tow-rope,
when, by continuing to steam on, the torpedo will
diverge into contact with the bottom of the vessel attacked,
as shown in the drawing. <i>When skilfully performed</i>, the
total destruction of the enemy is certain, since the torpedo
is springing from a depth to the surface, and will, in consequence,
strike near the keel. The torpedo vessel can pass
at her greatest speed, and, if thought necessary, near
enough to clear away any of the ordinary obstructions, such
as booms, nets, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>CASE 4.<br /><span class="smaller">ATTACKING A VESSEL AT ANCHOR BY COMING UP RIGHT ASTERN AND
THEN PASSING ON EITHER SIDE.</span></h3>

<p>In this case, having determined upon the side it is desirable
to pass, a torpedo is launched accordingly. When
near the vessel, the torpedo is sufficiently diverged, and
the torpedo vessel passing onwards ahead, the torpedo is
brought under the run or bottom of the vessel attacked, as
shown by the drawing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="plate7">

<h3>CASE 5.<br />
<span class="smaller">PASSING DOWN BETWEEN TWO LINES OF VESSELS AT ANCHOR, AND
DESTROYING THEM ON EITHER SIDE.</span></h3>

<p>In this case, it would be impossible to fire at the torpedo
vessel for fear of injury to their friends. Two or more
torpedo vessels following each other with preconcerted
signals would cause great destruction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="plate8">

<h3>CASE 6.<br />
<span class="smaller">ATTACKING A VESSEL IN MOTION BY COMING DOWN FROM RIGHT
AHEAD.</span></h3>

<p>In this case, two torpedoes are launched, port and starboard,
each diverging to its full extent; when passing the
vessel attacked, one or the other of the tow-ropes is brought
across the cut-water, and by the simultaneous motion of the
two vessels in opposite directions, the torpedo is brought
alongside of or under the bottom of the vessel attacked, as
shown by the drawing. The torpedo vessel should keep the
masts of her enemy in one until close to, when either
torpedo will be used, according to the movement of the
enemy. At the time of the tow-rope taking the cut-water,
the brake is suddenly eased up; the tow-rope will then
pass under the bottom, when, by checking the tow-rope,
the torpedo will be hauled under the bottom.</p>

<h3>CASE 7.<br />
<span class="smaller">ATTACKING A VESSEL IN MOTION, COMING UP TO HER FROM RIGHT
ASTERN.</span></h3>

<p>In this case, two torpedoes are launched and diverged, as
in Case 6; and in this case it is assumed that the torpedo
vessel can outspeed the vessel attacked, which will enable
her to bring a torpedo under the run of the vessel attacked,
as shown by the drawing.</p>

<span class="smaller">IF CHASED BY A HOSTILE VESSEL, AND IT IS DEEMED UNADVISABLE
TO FACE HER AND PROCEED AS IN CASE 6.</span></h3>

<p>In this case, veer a torpedo astern, having first obtained
a position a little on the bow of the chasing vessel. When
it is known, by the length of the tow-rope out, that the
torpedo is about abreast of her bow, hold fast the tow-rope,
which will cause the torpedo to diverge, and be brought
into contact, as shown in the drawing. As a last resort,
drop spanned torpedoes.</p>

<p>In this case, the torpedo being diverged when near, will,
after crossing the bow, be dragged into contact, as shown
by the drawing.</p>

<p>Torpedoes can be used with a stern-board, if necessary.
The port torpedo, in this case, will be launched on the starboard
side, and the starboard on the port side.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it should be stated that a dark night and
tempestuous weather are in favour of the attacking torpedo
vessels; and these conditions are especially advantageous
when attacking large, long, unwieldy vessels, and the
greater the number of them together, the more easily can
they be disabled or destroyed, by reason of consequent
confusion. Though the sea torpedo can be used in the
light of day, or darkness of night, by vessels of the present
navies, armed with cannon, it is nevertheless earnestly
advised that fast vessels be built of comparatively small
size and cost, adapted to the service of and armed with
torpedoes, by reason that such vessels can keep at sea for
long periods without replenishing supplies of coals and provisions;
and in conflict upon the ocean, can easily destroy
or render unseaworthy vessels, how large soever they may
be, and armed with any cannon and projectiles at present
known. Hence the necessity of being prepared with
vessels suited to the change in naval warfare, and with
officers well practised in an arm which, sooner or later,
will be adopted by all Maritime States, by reason of its
economy and efficiency. In the tactics, here attempted to
be rendered intelligible, it is presumed that the various
modes of attack are by small handy vessels adapted to the
service, and armed with torpedoes, against large unwieldy
vessels, armed with cannon. When it shall have been
clearly demonstrated, in actual war, that large vessels can
be disabled or destroyed by small vessels, with something
like impunity, torpedo warfare will then take another form,
that of torpedo vessels against torpedo vessels, whose tactics
will, in due time, be a subject for another study.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The subjoined is a Remark upon the Description of Vessel
adapted to the Service of the Sea Torpedo.</span></h2>

<p>Vessels adapted to the service of the sea torpedo should
be about 400 tons burthen; her extreme length, over all,
from taffrail to figure-head, about 150 feet. The form of
body to be such as to attain the greatest practicable speed.</p>

<p>Speed being the essential condition of a torpedo vessel, a
perfectly flush upper or weather deck, without any bulwarks,
is advisable; instead of bulwarks, life-lines, supported
by stanchions, supply their place to prevent accidents
of falling overboard. Thus fitted, there would be
nothing to hold wind that could retard speed, as there is in
vessels of ordinary build. So covered in, the vessel would
not, under any condition of weather, ship water; she
would not, from such cause, be in any danger of foundering.</p>

<p>The height of the weather-deck above the water-line at
midships, 9 feet; the height of the main deck above the
water-line, 18 inches; leaving a clear height between decks
of 6 feet 6 inches. There should be two water-tight bulkheads,
one about 50 feet from the stem, and the other about
20 feet from the stern-post; the two water-tight bulkheads
come up to the under side of the main deck, with which the
bulkhead form perfectly water-tight compartments. In the
fore compartment, empty water-tight cases would occupy
the lower part, over which would be stowed the cork
buoys and some light resisting material, rendered uninflammable,
so that in the event of the fore body being
ripped open below the water-line, there would be no space
for the admission of water; the trim of the vessel would
therefore be preserved. The after compartment would be
similarly stowed. There would be a capacious engine-room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
to allow of powerful engines to work twin screws; there
would also be capacious coal-bunkers and a coal-hold before
the engine-room; and before the coal-hold a small hold for
the stowage of cables and various articles. There would
also be a pilot-house, in which would be protected the
officer in command, who would be so placed as to have his
orders immediately obeyed. The torpedo-room, to contain
about one hundred torpedoes of various destructive powers,
the weight of which may be about 10 tons, would be in
the after body, and as low down as may be convenient.
Upon the orlop deck, which covers the magazine, would be
the towing gear, and machinery for working such gear.
On the orlop deck would also be a steering wheel, by which
the vessel would be steered when in action. The space
between the decks of the entire length of the vessel would
afford ample accommodation for officers and crew, embracing,
also, stowage for provisions and means of cooking.
Ventilation and light would be obtained by hatchways,
fitted with skylights; and there would also be side scuttles,
which, from their height above water, would admit of
their being generally open. The rig would be that of a
three-masted schooner, having fore, main, and mizen gaffsails,
with a fore staysail and two jibs, inner and outer.
When going into action, the sails would be lowered and
stowed; the vessel would then be entirely under steam.
To each mast there would be a yard of suitable dimensions,
for the double purpose of towing the torpedoes and setting
flying square sails. The rigging would not be rattled; the
ascent to the masthead would be by a Jacob’s ladder
before the mast; there would be a small top to each masthead,
principally for the use of the look-out men. The
crew would be stationed upon the orlop deck, each man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
being provided with a life-belt. With regard to boats,
there may be a small stern boat, and two larger boats,
stowed on deck; and upon going into action, gripes or
lashings should be cast off so that the boats would instantly
be disengaged from the vessel.</p>

<p>Torpedo vessels for foreign service should, under the present
difficulties of keeping iron from oxidizing and fouling,
be built of timber. For home service, vessels constructed
of iron would be preferable, and with very reduced masts,
to enable them to pass under the yards of a vessel. One
or two light guns, to bring-to an unarmed vessel, and for
signal purposes, on the weather-deck, and fired over all.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
